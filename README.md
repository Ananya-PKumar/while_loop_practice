My solutions to 5 practice questions made by ChatGPT.


Here is what GPT spat out after I asked it to give me practice around "while" loops:

ðŸ”„ 1. Count up to a number
Task: Ask the user for a number, then use a while loop to print every number starting at 1 up to that number.

ðŸ”„ 2. Guessing game
Task: Generate a secret number (e.g. secret = 7). Have the user guess repeatedly in a while loop until they get it right. Print a message after each wrong guess.

ðŸ”„ 3. Sum of numbers until 0
Task: Use a while loop to keep asking the user for numbers. Keep a running sum of all the numbers they enter. Stop the loop when the user enters 0. Print the total sum.

ðŸ”„ 4. Print even numbers up to N
Task: Ask the user for a number N. Use a while loop to print all even numbers between 2 and N.

ðŸ”„ 5. Factorial calculator
